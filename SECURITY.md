## Responsible Disclosure Examples

### Good Vulnerability Reports

**Example 1: API Vulnerability**
```
Subject: SQL Injection in Weather API

Description: The weather API endpoint /api/weather accepts user input 
without proper sanitization, allowing SQL injection attacks.

Impact: Attackers could potentially access the entire database.

Reproduction:
1. Send POST request to /api/weather
2. Include malicious SQL in the 'location' parameter
3. Observe database error messages revealing structure

Proof of Concept: [Include code or screenshots]

Affected Component: backend/modules/weather_service.py, line 45

Suggested Fix: Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
```

**Example 2: Authentication Bypass**
```
Subject: Authentication Bypass in Emergency Features

Description: Emergency features can be accessed without proper authentication
by manipulating the request headers.

Impact: Unauthorized users could send false emergency alerts.

Reproduction:
1. Access emergency endpoint without authentication
2. Add custom header X-Emergency-Override: true
3. Successfully send emergency alert

Suggested Fix: Implement proper authentication checks for all emergency endpoints
```

### What Makes a Good Report

- **Clear description** of the vulnerability
- **Specific details** about affected components
- **Step-by-step reproduction** instructions
- **Realistic impact assessment**
- **Constructive suggestions** for fixes
